Installation instructions
-------------------------

If you have ``pip`` on your system, that's the easiest way:
::

  pip install mpipe

Or you may provide ``--user`` flag if you don't have root privs:
::

  pip install --user mpipe

Another way is using ``easy_install``:
::

  easy_install mpipe

Or you can clone the repo and run the *Distutils* installer:
::

  git clone http://github.com/vmlaker/mpipe
  cd mpipe
  python setup.py install --user

Another way to get the source code is from the Package Index at 
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mpipe.
